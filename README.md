# autogitpull
Automatic Git Puller & Monitor

By default, repositories whose `origin` remote does not point to GitHub or require
authentication are skipped during scanning. Pass `--include-private` after the
root folder to include these repositories.

Use `--show-skipped` to display repositories that were skipped in the TUI.
